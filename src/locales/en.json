Each impact chain outlines the cause-effect relationships among risk elements leading to the outcomes of particular hazard-exposure pairings. To assess climate risk, indicators are categorized into hazard, exposure, and vulnerability (encompassing coping capacity and sensitivity). The selection of relevant indicators for each category is guided by the city's strategic risks, data availability, and crucially, co-creation workshops with experts and stakeholders.",
      "q2": "What do we mean by Hazard and exposure?",
      "a2": "In climate risk analysis, a hazard is any potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon, or human activity that may cause loss of life, injury, property damage, social and economic disruption, or environmental degradation. Hazards encompass both natural events like floods and droughts, as well as human-made incidents such as pollution spills or urban fires, with a particular focus on changes in climate. Exposure, on the other hand, refers to the presence of people, livelihoods, ecosystems, resources, infrastructure, or economic and cultural assets in locations that could be adversely affected by these hazards. It measures the extent to which a system is subject to potential harm.",
      "q3": "What do we mean by vulnerability? ",
      "a3": "Vulnerability measures how susceptible a system or community is to damage from climate hazards, based on sensitivity—the degree to which it's affected by climate changes—and coping capacity, or its ability to manage and adapt to these impacts. Sensitivity involves factors like location and socio-economic status, whereas coping capacity embodies resources and adaptation strategies, such as nature-based solutions, which leverage ecosystem services to mitigate impacts and enhance resilience."
